# \# Chicago 311 City Service Request Analysis

# 

# \## Project Overview

# This project analyzes the City of Chicago’s 311 non-emergency service request data from 2021 to 2023.  

# The goal is to identify trends in service requests, evaluate response times, understand communication channels used by residents, and visualize the geographic distribution of requests across neighborhoods.  

# 

# Insights from this analysis can help city departments prioritize resources, improve response efficiency, and enhance overall service delivery.

#

# 

# \## Data Source

# The dataset is publicly available from the City of Chicago’s open data portal:  

# \[Chicago 311 Service Requests Dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/v6vf-nfxy.json)
